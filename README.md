# Deploying Java Web Application using Docker and Kubernetes with DevOps SDLC Process

This project showcases the deployment of a Java web application using Docker and Kubernetes, following a comprehensive DevOps Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process. The primary goal of the project is to provide a hands-on example of setting up a robust deployment pipeline for a Java-based web application in a containerized environment.

## Project Highlights

- Utilizes Docker for containerization, enabling consistent and portable deployment environments.
- Harnesses the power of Kubernetes for orchestration, ensuring scalability, load balancing, and self-healing capabilities.
- Adheres to a DevOps SDLC process, integrating continuous integration, continuous delivery, and automation practices.
- Demonstrates best practices for setting up deployment pipelines, optimizing resource utilization, and improving software delivery efficiency.
- Provides insights into effective collaboration between development and operations teams through a DevOps approach.
- Offers a practical learning resource for developers, DevOps engineers, and anyone interested in modern deployment practices.
