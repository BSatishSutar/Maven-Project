This project exemplifies the deployment of a Java web application using Docker and Kubernetes, within the framework of a comprehensive DevOps Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process. The primary objective of the project is to provide a practical demonstration of establishing a robust deployment pipeline for a Java-based web application within a containerized environment.

## Project Highlights

- Leverages Docker for containerization, ensuring consistent and portable deployment environments.
- Harnesses the capabilities of Kubernetes for orchestration, guaranteeing scalability, load balancing, and autonomous recovery features.
- Embraces a DevOps SDLC process, seamlessly integrating continuous integration, continuous delivery, and automation principles.
- Illustrates optimal practices for configuring deployment pipelines, refining resource allocation, and enhancing the efficiency of software delivery.
- Offers insights into fostering effective collaboration between development and operations teams through a DevOps approach.
- Serves as a valuable learning resource for developers, DevOps engineers, and individuals interested in modern deployment methodologies.

## Prerequisites

Prior to beginning the project, it is essential to ensure the installation of the following prerequisites:

1. An EC2 instance, utilizing either the 'Ubuntu AMI' or an alternative AMI according to your preference. Additionally, opt for an 't2.medium or higher' instance type.
2. Docker software.
3. Minikube.
